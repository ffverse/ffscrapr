## Limitations of ff_scoringhistory

For all sites: 

- Official NFL lateral scoring may be different than MFL scoring
- Special team TDs are not broken down into punt returns, kick returns, and FG returns in nflfastR `load_player_stats` so the kick return scoring was applied to all special team TDs
- No support for IDPs, team defenses, kickers, coaches, fumbles, return yards, offensive fumble recoveries
- Support for eccentric rules (bonuses for long plays, conditional rules) will be added on a request basis

For Fleaflicker:
- Does Fleaflicker allow for ranged scoring rules like MFL? (assume no)

For Sleeper:
- Does Sleeper allow for ranged scoring rules like MFL? (assume no)
- Does Sleeper allow for positional scoring rules? (assume no)
